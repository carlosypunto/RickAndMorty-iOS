/// - Caching: Results obtained from services can be stored in the provided
///   cache to avoid redundant work and improve performance. The default
///   cache is `MemoryCache`, but any `RepositoryCache` implementation can
///   be injected for custom behaviors (e.g., persistence, size limits, or
///   eviction policies).
