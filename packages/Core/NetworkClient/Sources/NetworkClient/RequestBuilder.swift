/// A builder type to progressively construct URL requests from a base URL.

/// A concrete builder for creating `URLRequest` instances from a base URL.
///
/// Use `RequestBuilder` to progressively configure request components starting
/// from a `base` URL. Currently, it supports setting a path component and
/// exposes the resulting `URLRequest` via the `request` computed property.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// let base = URL(string: "https://api.example.com")!
/// let request = RequestBuilder(base: base)
///     .setPath("v1/users")
///     .request
/// ```
/// This produces a request targeting: https://api.example.com/v1/users
public final class RequestBuilder: URLRequestBuilder {
    /// The base URL used to compose the final request URL.
    private let base: URL
    /// Optional path component appended to the base URL.
    private var path: String?

    /// The built `URLRequest` for the current configuration.
    ///
    /// If a `path` has been set, it is appended to `base`; otherwise the request
    /// points to `base` directly.
    public var request: URLRequest {
        if let path {
            return URLRequest(url: base.appending(path: path))
        }
        return URLRequest(url: base)
    }

    /// Creates a new builder with the given base URL.
    /// - Parameter base: The base endpoint for the request.
    public init(base: URL) {
        self.base = base
    }

    /// Sets the path component to be appended to the base URL.
    /// - Parameter path: The path segment (do not include a leading slash when using `URL.appending(path:)`).
    /// - Returns: The same builder instance to allow method chaining.
    @discardableResult
    public func setPath(_ path: String) -> RequestBuilder {
        self.path = path
        return self
    }
